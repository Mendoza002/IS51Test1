The Salary program is trying to determine which payment option is better (aka which pays the most).
The first option is $100 per day for 10 days.
The second option is $1 a day with it doubling each day for 10 days.
With this there will be two functions to calculate the pay rate.
function1 will calculate the amount for the first option, and function2 will calculate the amount for the second option.

function1 will output 100 * 10 days.
function2 will loop 10 times, with each time it doubles the amount and adds the amount to the total.

if the total amount is equal, we output to the user "Option 1 and Option 2 pays the same"
if the option1 is better, we output to the user "Option 1 is better"
if the option2 is better, we output to the user "Option 2 is better"
